Repository for my IBM AI/ML project based certification course
The colab notes reflect strutured approach to ML/AI problem solving
  1. After problem is defined and understood - Plan data collection and retrieve the data Colab files with phrases "Data Retrieval and Data Pull" in that sequence reflect a structured template to follow for data pull
  2. The colab notes/file with phrase "Data_Cleaning" is good template/workflow for cleaning data for ML models
